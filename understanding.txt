Google in Rust => Gust 
Tf-idf => term frequency inverse document frequency
value = how frequent it is in that document / how freuqent it is in other document
It tells us it is noise or not 

Problem statement => docs.gl cam only search through names but not the things that are inside the the document

1. Convert XML into text 
2. Text into buffer 


Search
Idea => take prompt from user  and tokenize it 
then each token is used to compute the tfidf for each document 
we sum them up and we get ranking for each individual document
then we sort and give top 10
